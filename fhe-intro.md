# What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data ‚Äî without the need to decrypt it.

## üîê Why It Matters for Blockchain

- Users can interact with smart contracts without revealing any sensitive data.
- Ideal for private DeFi, healthcare records, and identity systems.
- Enables "Privacy by Default" for Web3 applications.

Zama leverages FHE to create a new paradigm of privacy-preserving smart contracts that compute on encrypted values end-to-end.
